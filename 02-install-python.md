# A Step-by-Step Guide to Installing Python and Creating a Python Environment

## Introduction:
Python, an incredibly versatile and powerful programming language, is widely used across various fields, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. To embark on your Python programming journey, it's crucial to install Python and set up a suitable Python environment. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of installing Python and creating a Python environment on your computer.

## Instructions

1. Downloading Python:

    The first step is to download Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/). Python is available for different operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux. Ensure that you download the version compatible with your system.

2. Installing Python:

    Once the download is complete, run the installation file and follow the installation wizard. On Windows, make sure to select the option to add Python to the system PATH, which allows you to access Python from any directory in the command prompt. On macOS and Linux, this is typically done automatically.

3. Verifying the Python Installation:

    After the installation, it's essential to verify that Python has been installed correctly. Open the command prompt (or terminal on macOS and Linux) and type the following command:

    ```sh
    python --version
    ```

    This command will display the installed Python version. If you see the version number, it means Python has been installed successfully.


4. Running Python Scripts:

    To execute Python scripts, simply run the "python" command followed by the script's filename:

    ```sh
    python script.py
    ```

    Replace "script.py" with the name of your Python script.


## Congratulations! 
You have successfully installed Python.  Next, install [`pip`](./03-install-pip.md) and then your [virtual environment](./04-install-your-virtual-environment.md)

**IMPORTANT** Remember to activate your virtual environment each time you start a new project to maintain a clean and isolated development environment. Happy coding with Python!
